#SASS and Gulp

SASS is used to write the CSS for this project. It is a language that extends CSS, and allows for variables and other functions. Gulp is used to process .scss files to .css files. 

## Installing and running Gulp
To run Gulp, you need to install Node and npm on your machine. 
Then navigate to the plugin directory in Terminal or Cmd. 

If you pulled the plugin from Git, you will need to install a local Gulp installation. Type the following command in the plugin root directory:
"npm install gulp"

After you have installed Gulp, you can type the command 'gulp.' Gulp will then watch the scss files for changes and compile them to the css/stylesheets folder.

If you are going to edit the CSS, make sure to edit it through the .scss files and use Gulp to process them into .css files. This keeps the process consistent for future developers.
